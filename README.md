Yet Another CSV library
=====

You might be wondering why do we need one more java CSV library? Well, I honestly looked-through most of the CSV libraries here on github. And they are:

 * mostly overcomplidated. CSV library which converts cells using patterns?
 * do not follow jdk designs and patterns. CsvClient? 
 * consume a lot of memory and resources. Not always, but quite frequently
 
Of course, I could contribute to this open source products. But hey, I couldn't change their fundumental principles.

So I decided create yet another CSV library. Hope it will be small and simply to use.
